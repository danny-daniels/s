
In pandas Axis=0 refer as row and axis=1 refer as column

Matplotlib- it is library used for creating static and interactive visualizations
seaborn- data visualization library
Pandas – It is used for working with datasets, it has functions such as analyzing,cleaning, exploring and manipulating data
Scikit-learn - open source data analysis library

cleaning data:removing incorrect data
manipulating data:method of organizing data

Data Normalization -  Process of recognizing data within the database

DataFrame - 2-dimensional data structure that can store different types  of data

1.Reshaping data -in the Variable column, we can reshape the data by categorizing them into
different numbers.
2.Merge operation- is used to merge raw data and into the desired format.
3.Filtering data-Some times datasets are comprised of unwanted rows or columns which are
required to be removed or filtered

1.Boxplot method-It captures the summary of the data effectively and efficiently with only a simple box
2.Scatter Plot Method-It is used when you have paired numerical data, or when your dependent variable has multiple values for each reading independent variable, or when trying to determine the relationship between the two variables.
3.Z-score Method-It is also called a standard score. This value/score helps to understand that how far is the data point from the mean. And after setting up a threshold value one can utilize z score values of data points to define the outliers
4.IQR-Inter Quartile Range approach to finding the outliers is the most commonly used and most trusted approach used in the research field
5.MinMax Scaler- It just scales all the data between 0 and 1.
6.Standard Scaler- scales the values such that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1
7.Log Transform- convert a skewed distribution to a normal distribution

1.Statistics-is a branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing empirical data.
2.Mean-sum of all observations divided by the number of observations.
3.Mode-most frequently occurring value in your data
4.Median-middle value of a data.
5.Standard Deviation -measure of how spread out numbers are,square root of Variance
6.Varience -average of the squared differences from the Mean

1.Linear regression: used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable


1.Regression: estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or 
more independent variables
2.Dependent variable: target variable which we are trying to predict.
3.Independent variables: a variable that stands alone and isn't changed by the other variables
4.logistic Regression: estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote
5.Precision: Out of all the positive predicted, what percentage is truly positive.
Formula= TP/TP+FP
The precision value lies between 0 and 1.
6.Recall: Out of the total positive, what percentage are predicted positive.
Formula=TP/TP+FN
7.Accuracy: it is correct prediction and it tells overall correctness
Formula=TP+TN/TP+FP+TN+FN
8.confusion matrix: used for finding the errors in prediction 
                            Actual
                   Positive        Negative
        Positive      TP              FP
Predicted 
        Negative     FN               TN
9.True Positive: predicted positive and it’s true
10.True Negative: predicted negative and it’s true.
11.False Positive: predicted positive and it’s false.
12.False Negative: predicted negative and it’s false.

1.Naïve Bayes Classifier can be used for Classification of categorical data

1.Tokenization: The process of breaking down a text paragraph into smaller words or sentence is called Tokenization.
2.Stopwords: considered as noise in the text.
3.Stemming: Convert capital letter In small letter
4.Lemmatization: make the word list
5.POS Tagging: Part Of Speech it find the noun pronoun verb


A. Distribution Plots
a. Dist-Plot- represents the univariate analysis

d. Rug Plot- draw small bars along the x-axis for each point

B. Categorical Plots
a. Bar Plot- display the mean value
b. Count Plot- displays the count
c. Box Plot- display the distribution of the categorical data in the form of quartiles.
d. Violin Plot- statistical representation of numerical data

C. Advanced Plots
a. Strip Plot- draws a scatter plot
b. Swarm Plot- combination of the strip and the violin plots.

D. Matrix Plots
a. Heat Map-2d representation of data
b. Cluster Map-

1.scatter -plot how two variables relate to each other
2.Pie Chart: same as the countplot, gives additional info about the percentage
3.Histogram: value distribution plot of numerical columns.
4.Scatter Plot: To plot relationship between two numerical variables
